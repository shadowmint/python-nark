class Messenger(object):
  """ Messenger is a event handler / trigger to pass between processes.
  
      To use messenger, you would typically do something like this:
      
      pc, cc = Pipe(True)
      pm = Messenger(pc)
      cc = Messenger(cc)
      p = Process(target=blah, args=(cc,))
      p.start()
      
      running = True
      while running:
        # do normal app loop things, and then periodically call:
        pm.poll()
        
      Basically messenger wraps Pipe and lets messages get sent back
      and forth between processes. 
      
      Every message sent is wrapped in an event type container, which
      messenger uses to dispatch to listening callbacks.
      
      You can register callbacks using listen(), eg:
      
      pm.listen(EVENT_ID, my_callback)
      
      ...and trigger events *on the remote side of the pipe* using:
      
      pm.trigger(EVENT_ID, event)
      
      Notice specifically that unless both sides of the pipe are in the
      same process (in which case, why are you even using this?) calling
      trigger() will NOT trigger events attached to the local listener,
      regardless of event id.
